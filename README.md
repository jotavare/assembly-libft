## ABOUT

This project aims to convert the `C` functions from my [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft) library to `x86 Assembly`. The goal is to understand `Assembly` better and assess the efficiency of these functions compared to their `C` counterparts.

To access the repository and the documentation where I learned to code in `x86 Assembly` with NASM, click [here](https://github.com/jotavare/x86-assembly-nasm).
