## About

This project aims to convert the `C` functions from my **Libft** library to `x86 Assembly` with **NASM**. The goal is to understand x86 assembly better and assess the efficiency of these functions compared to their C counterparts.

| Repository | Description |
| :--------- | :---------- |
| [Libft](https://github.com/jotavare/libft) | My custom C library containing 43 functions, written from scratch. |
| [x86 Assembly NASM Docs](https://jotavare.github.io/x86_assembly_nasm) | Documentation detailing my process of learning x86 assembly with NASM. |
| [x86 Assembly NASM Files](https://github.com/jotavare/x86-assembly-nasm) | Repository containing my files produced while learning x86 assembly with NASM. |
